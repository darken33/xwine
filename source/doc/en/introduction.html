<h2><a name="1.1."></a>1.1. Wine : an Ms-Windows emulator?</h2>
<p>When you want to use Linux and Ms-Windows applications, you login
Linux to use Linux's ones (i.e. Kdevelop) or Windows
to use Windows's ones (i.e. Ms-Word).
But each time you need to restart the computer on the operating system
of the application you want to use. The Wine project has been done to
solve that issue. Wine allows to execute Ms-Windows applications when
running Linux, as it were specific Linux applications. </p>
<p> Wine is not exactly an emulator ; it is an
implementation of the Windows libraries under Linux operating
system. You might compile your Windows applications directly under
Linux ; that means you should have the source files of these
applications. But you may run your Windows applications under Linux
without compiling them ; here is explained that functionality. </p>
<p>Since Wine is an implementation of Windows libraries under
Linux operating system, it is not even necessary to have an installed
Windows operating system on your computer to run your Windows
applications. </p>
<p>However Wine has some disadvantages
: its configuration file is not easy to use ; for example, in order to
add a hard disk, you should edit this file and&nbsp;add the new disk
configuration at the right place ; moreover, Wine will not work
properly when you make a mistake&nbsp; within that&nbsp; file. </p>
<p>Finally, Wine launches an application by typing command lines on a
terminal, with the needed options depending on the specificities of the
application to run. So its use is a little bit hard because of the need
to type these Linux command lines,
and to remember the needed options for each application. </p>

<h2><a name="1.2."></a>1.2. XWine : a&nbsp; graphical interface for Wine</h2>
<p> The&nbsp; XWine project was created in July
2001, its first goal was to execute an&nbsp; Ms Windows
application&nbsp; through Wine with only a simple click
under a graphical interface. XWine should allow to
configure the Wine emulator parameters for a Windows application, then
launch it with a simple click with all the configured options. </p>
<p>Several people who downloaded XWine asked me explanations to
configure the emulator, so I decided to add a Graphical Configuration
section in the XWine functionalities. Indeed it is more convenient to
configure the emulator by themes within a graphical interface,
and it avoids to introduce mistakes within the configuration
file, because it is not changed manually.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The XWine last goal is to manage these Ms-Windows applications. When
an application does not work correctly
and loops, it is important to kill it easily. In fact this
application is not managed by the Linux graphical manager (it does not
appear on the taskbar) ; so I added a taskbar within XWine to be able
to
kill that application. I added also a log file which stores all
tasks done under XWine and all messages coming from the
Wine emulator.<br>

<h2><a name="1.3."></a>1.3. Wine / XWine : an alternative solution<br>
</h2>
<p> Wine and XWine make together an interesting solution for three
different uses : </p>
<p> <u>The Windows / Linux complementarity :</u><br>
When both systems are installed, it is likely to use all applications
under Linux without rebooting the computer ; it makes time
savings and makes you more efficient. <br>
</p>
<p><u>Windows to Linux </u><u>migration </u><u>:</u><br>
Many people hesitate to use Linux because their preferred application
does not exist under this operating system. Using&nbsp; Wine/XWine they
can get rid of the Ms-Windows License cost, and continue to work with
their application.<br>
</p>
<p> <u>Using only Linux&nbsp; :</u><br>
A Linux experienced user could be bored to use a
system which is not compatible with MS-Windows systems.&nbsp; It is
definitely right for data format : doc, ppt, bmp, etc. A multi-platform
applications developer (Java, C, C++, ...) should test them under
a&nbsp;
MS-Windows system. Wine/XWine allows him to work without having the
MS-Windows
License cost. </p>
